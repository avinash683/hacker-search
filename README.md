## Description

A simple React search component for the Hacker News Algolia API,
you can use the app to search and display results from the Hacker News Algolia API.

## Installation Instructions

### 1. Clone the repo from GitHub

Navigate to the directory where you'd like to store the app, and enter the following command into git bash:

`https://github.com/avinash683/hacker-search.git`

This will copy the repo into a folder in the directory you navigated to in git bash.

### 2. Run Installation Commands

Ensure that you have installed the requirements to run `npm`. The following article will walk you through first time installation:
[Installing Nodejs and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

In the terminal or git bash, run the following command:

`npm install`

This will initiate an installation of the npm packages required to run the React app.

### 3. Start the Dev Server

Once you have installed the project's npm packages, enter the following command into terminal or git bash to start the development server:

`npm start`

The development server will start on the configured port (the default is port 3000, but can be set to a different value by setting the PORT environment variable). The page will load, and once React renders the app, you can begin using it.

You've now completed the installation.
